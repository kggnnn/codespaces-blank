# My Music Studio

This is a minimal prototype of a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) built with Electron and React. It includes basic track management and a placeholder timeline. More advanced features such as audio recording, MIDI, and effects would need to be implemented.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and Electron.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
